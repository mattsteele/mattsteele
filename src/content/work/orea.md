The Oklahoma Retired Educators Association is a professional organization that advocates for the benefits of retired teachers. The group is organized by multiple districts that collectively work with the state government to make sure teachers are taken care of in their golden years.

Multiple awards are given throughout the year to members for their contributions to OREA. Additionally, they hold many meetings at both the district and state level to forward their agenda.

The website allows them to keep members informed of recent news that affects them, see who their representatives are, and find out how they can be active in the association.
